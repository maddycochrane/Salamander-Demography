# Salamander-Demography
R script used for analyses in "Stage-specific demographic effects of hydrologic variation in a stream salamander." 

Script created by Madaline Cochrane. 

Salamander mark-recapture data available from Environmental Data Initiative Data Portal https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/cd5f5a03df194930bf87eb12157b8182 (Lowe 2022). Headwater stream discharge data available from Environmental Data Initiative Data Portal https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/15b300e96c2d2f9785d0155b3e18b0e9 (USDA Forest Service 2022). 

The README file(s) should provide a brief overall description of each data fileâ€™s contents, and a list of all variable names with explanation (e.g. units). This should allow a new reader to understand what the entries in each column mean and relate this information to the Methods and Results of your paper.
